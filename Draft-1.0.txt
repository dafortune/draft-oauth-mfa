1.  Introduction

   This specification...

2.  Authorization Session

2.1.  Error Response

   In addition to the error codes defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749],
   the following error codes are specific multi-factor authorization
   flows:

   mfa_required

      The authorization server requires multi-factor authentication.

   When the error code is set to mfa_required, the following parameters
   are included with the response:

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token used to continue the authorization
      session.

3.  Initiating Authorization using 1st Factor

3.1.  Resource Owner Password Credentials

3.1.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request as described in in Section 4.3.2 of
   [RFC6749].

3.1.2.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

   If the access token request is unauthorized because policy requires a
   second factor of authentication,...

4.  Obtaining Authorization using 2nd Factor

4.1.  OTP Device

4.1.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type

      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/2fa-otp".

   otp

      REQUIRED.  The one-time password.

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received from the first factor access
      token response.

4.1.2.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in in Section 5.1 of [RFC6749].  If the request
   failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server
   returns an error response as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].

4.2.  Out-of-Band Device

4.2.1.  Access Token Request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
   following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
   request entity-body:

   grant_type

      REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-
      type/2fa-oob".

      REQUIRED.  The out-of-band verification code.

   mfa_token

      REQUIRED.  The MFA token received from the first factor access
      token response.

4.2.2.  Access Token Response
